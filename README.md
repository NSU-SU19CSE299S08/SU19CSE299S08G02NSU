## Objectives:

At present time, we all use many web-applications and windows applications. Sometimes using this apps become so boring. But we can’t think of our basic life without using it. For instance, sending mail has become a very important part of our life and yet, it’s so boring to type and add selected files to it. Or putting our login credentials to different web apps. The part that we almost never talk about is losing our login credentials to hackers. It is very easy for the hackers to put a simple keylogger into any files and get all our important information; information like credit card number, pin codes, email and passwords. Think about our web browser. We usually saved our password into it. It may be the easiest way for the hackers to get our full information. As a close victim to this attack, I feel the need to create a software which will do this all the boring yet needed work for us; Serena, a virtual assistant who will cover all the problem above and more.
